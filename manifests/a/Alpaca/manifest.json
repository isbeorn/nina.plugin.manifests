        "ShortDescription": "A plugin to host all N.I.N.A. devices as Alpaca Devices to be accessed from other applications",
        "LongDescription": "\r\nThis plugin exposes all N.I.N.A. devices as Alpaca devices over the network, enabling control of your equipment from any ASCOM/Alpaca-compliant software or client. Each device is tightly integrated with N.I.N.A.'s interface abstractions, ensuring seamless operation and access to N.I.N.A.'s advanced features.\r\n\r\nAdditionally, exposing devices via Alpaca allows native or in-process drivers in N.I.N.A. to be shared with other applications.\r\n\r\nTip: For applications that cannot natively connect to Alpaca devices, you can use the ASCOM Chooser to make Alpaca drivers accessible as ASCOM drivers. See [Alpaca through the Chooser](https://ascom-standards.org/Help/Platform/html/e3870a2f-582a-4ab4-b37f-e9b1c37a2030.htm) in the ASCOM documentation for setup instructions.\r\n\r\n",
