    "ShortDescription": "Controls the ASG Astronomy electronically assisted tilt device for precise sensor tilt correction.",
    "LongDescription": "The ASG Electronically Assisted Tilt (EAT) plugin gives you full control of the ASG EAT motorized tilt device from within NINA's imaging tab.\n\nFeatures:\n- Four independent stepper motors with directional tilt (Top, Bottom, Left, Right) and corner tilt (TL, TR, BL, BR) controls\n- Backfocus adjustment moving all four motors together with ~1.8 micron per step resolution and ~2mm total range\n- Real-time motor position tracking updated after every movement\n- Camera orientation mapping for 0, 90, 180, and 270 degree sensor rotations so controls always match your setup\n- Configurable motor speed, max speed, and acceleration saved directly to the device\n- Auto-connect on startup to your saved COM port and baud rate\n- Activity log with timestamped serial traffic monitoring\n- Raw command interface for sending custom commands to the Arduino controller\n- Customizable sensor visualization with 16 color presets\n- Connection status LED indicator (gray = disconnected, green = idle, red = moving)\n\nDesigned for astrophotographers using the ASG EAT hardware on systems like Celestron RASA and Hyperstar setups. Connects via USB serial to the Arduino-based EAT controller with support for baud rates from 9600 to 115200.",
