This makes handling more mobile and convenient, especially when setting up equipment and starting imaging sessions.\r\n\r\n## üß© **Important Notes**\r\n- This web app **requires a fully configured and running installation of NINA**.\r\n- It requires the **Advanced API** plugin in the latest beta version with the following settings:\r\n  - API v2 must be enabled\r\n  - Port must be set to 1888\r\n  - \"Use Access-Control-Allow-Origin Header\" must be enabled\r\n- For Three Point Polar Alignment, version 2.2.2.0 or newer is required.\r\n- It is intended as a complement to the desktop software and provides mobile support for basic functions.\r\n- I assume no liability\r\n  \r\n## üîß **Installation**\r\n- After installing the plugin, Touch'N'Stars can be accessed via http://<NINA - PC - IP>:5000.\r\n\r\n## üß™ **What does the Alpha Version offer?**  \r\n- **Mobile Operation**: Easily access NINA through your smartphone or tablet.\r\n- **User-Friendly Design**: Simple and intuitive interface specifically optimized for mobile devices.\r\n- **Focus on Practicality**: Support for essential steps in setting up your equipment.\r\n\r\n## üíô **Acknowledgements**  \r\nMy thanks go to the entire **NINA** development team, whose great work makes this web app possible.\r\nA special thank you to **Christian**, the developer of the **Advanced API**, for his efforts and support. His work has significantly enabled the development of this web app.",
