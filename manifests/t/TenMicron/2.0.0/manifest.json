        "LongDescription": "This plugin provides tools for 10 micron mounts, such as building pointing models.\r\n\r\n* NOTE: This plugin is still in active development *\r\n\r\n# Features #\r\n\r\n* Build full sky models using Golden Spiral in an Imaging tab dock\r\n* Sidereal Path model point generation that creates points along the sidereal path of a DSO\r\n* Advanced Sequencer items to build, load, and save models as part of a sequence\r\n* MW4 and NINA horizons supported. Load the horizon file in NINA Options -\u003e General\r\n* Dome optimization to reduce dome slews during model build\r\n* View and save loaded alignment models\r\n* Load and Delete existing alignment models\r\n* Remove the worst alignment star from a loaded alignment model\r\n* Retry individual points that have high RMS\r\n* Retry model build failures using only the failed points, unless a maximum number of failures is exceeded\r\n* Advanced Sequencer item to set tracking rates not exposed by the ASCOM driver\r\n\r\n# Coming Soon #\r\n\r\n* Altitude-aware dome shutter calculations. By setting a dome shutter width in the model builder settings, a wider dome slit clearance will be used for higher altitudes to further reduce the number of dome slews\r\n* Advanced Sequencer item to build full-sky models\r\n\r\n# Getting Help #\r\n\r\nIf you have questions, come ask in the **#plugin-discussions** channel on the NINA [Discord chat server](https://discord.com/invite/rWRbVbw).\r\n* 10 Micron Tools is provided \u0027as is\u0027 under the terms of the [Mozilla Public License 2.0](https://github.com/ghilios/NINA.Joko.Plugin.TenMicron/blob/develop/LICENSE.txt)\r\n* Source code for this plugin is available at this plugin\u0027s [source code repository](https://github.com/ghilios/NINA.Joko.Plugin.TenMicron)\r\n",
