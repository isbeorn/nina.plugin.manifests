        "ShortDescription": "Useful instructions to get the most out of the NINA Advanced Sequencer",
        "LongDescription": "This plugin contains a variety of potentially useful instructions that enhance the power of the Advanced Sequencer.  The set of these instructions is expected to increase over time; consider them 'utility' instructions.  Many of these instructions allow you to take arbitrary sets of actions when specific circumstances arise; you specify these actions by dragging instructions into place, just as you would to create any instruction set or template.  (NOTE: This plugin includes all of the functionality of the 'Interrupts' plugin, which is now obsolete; it is also renamed from 'When (and If)').\r\n\r\nThese are the instructions that are current in Sequencer Powerups, broken down by the Category in which they appear in the instruction sidebar.\r\n\r\nCONSTANTS ENHANCED (new Category):\r\n\r\n** NOTE: Sequencer Powerups now supercedes the 'Constants for Exposures' plugin.  Instructions from the deprecated plugin will no longer work if you remove that plugin! **\r\n\r\nDefine Constant - Define a Constant that can be used in the other 'Constants Enhanced' instructions.  The value of constants can include references to other, previously defined, constants.  In the plugin options page, there is the option to add up to four 'global' constants; constants that will be available in all sequences.  Values for constants can be arbitrarily complex arithmetic expressions, including the use of parentheses, not that I see any value in this...\r\n\r\nCool Camera - Same as built-in instruction, with the ability to use a constant for temperature\r\n\r\nTake Exposure/Take Many Exposures/Smart Exposure -  These three instructions are effectively copies of the built-in instructions, with the ability to use constants for iterations (smart/many), exposure time, gain, and dither.\r\n\r\nScreenshot: [Constants Example](https://1drv.ms/u/s!AjBSqKNCEWOTgfIEvcjHtr65Jl7W9Q?e=FM4WRF)\r\n\r\nSAFETY MONITOR:\r\n\r\nWhen Becomes Unsafe - This trigger is activated within SECONDS of your Safety Monitor registering an 'Unsafe' condition.  You specify the actions (instructions) to be taken in that circumstance - for example, you might want to \"Close Dome Shutter\", send yourself a message using the Ground Station plugin, and then \"Wait for Safe\".  After that, you might \"Open Dome Shutter\", send yourself another message, \"Run Autofocus\", and \"Slew and Center\".  When your instructions have finished executing, NINA will continue from where it left off!  And this instruction can be used repeatedly (the rain might start and stop and then start again...)  This instruction is likely to be much simpler to understand than multiple loops based on the 'safe' status of your gear.\r\n\r\nIf Safe - Specify instructions to execute if your Safety Monitor is currently reporting 'Safe'\r\n\r\nIf Unsafe - Specify instructions to execute if your Safety Monitor is currently reporting 'Unsafe'\r\n\r\nScrenshot: [When Becomes Unsafe Example](https://1drv.ms/u/s!AjBSqKNCEWOTgfIGHf3eIXv2hZfYAw?e=LLHMJF)\r\n\r\nSEQUENCER (new Category):\r\n\r\nTemplate By Reference - This powerful instruction incorporates the specified (by name) Template into your sequence/target/template at the time it is brought into the Advanced Sequencer screen.  A sequence/target/template that has one (or more) of this instruction, when saved, saves ONLY the name of the Template; in that way, you can update any of your Templates and have the updates reflected in ALL of the sequences/targets/templates that use that Template!\r\n\r\nInterrupt Trigger - This instruction, when dragged into a running sequence, will STOP execution after the current instruction is finished and wait for you to add any instructions you wish to execute at that time.\r\n\r\nAutofocus Trigger - Like the above, but this will run an Autofocus instruction after the currently running instruction has finished executing (let's say you want to run an Autofocus NOW, for example)\r\n\r\nUTILITY:\r\n\r\nWait Indefinitely - Waits until you skip the instruction or delete it.  This may be useful if you need your sequence to wait for you to complete some manual task which will take an undetermined amount of time.\r\n\r\n\r\nComments, suggestions, bug reports, etc. are welcomed!  Contact me by DM @chatter on the NINA Discord server, or post in the #plugin-discussions channel.\r\n",
