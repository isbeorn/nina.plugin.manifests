        "ShortDescription": "A plugin that will provide sequencer instructions that are able to look for future targets and react accordingly.",
        "LongDescription": "This plugin is intended to provide some basic tools to improve multi target planning by scrying future targets and predicting their state to react on these.  \r\n\r\nFor example - you know that a target is obstructed until it reaches a certain altitude, so you want to loop another target for as long as that target is below that specific altitude.\r\n\r\n## Loop Conditions\r\n+ Loop While Hour Angle\r\n    + Loop the current target until a certain hour angle is reached\r\n+ Loop While Next Target Hour Angle\r\n    + Loop the current target until a certain hour angle for the next target is reached\r\n+ Loop While Next Target Below Altitude\r\n    + Loop the current target until the next target rises above a specified altitude\r\n+ Loop While Next Target Below Horizon\r\n    + Loop the current target until the next target rises above the horizon\r\n\r\n## Instructions\r\n+ Auto Balancing Exposure\r\n    + An imaging instruction that will automatically balance the exposures by the given exposure definitions\r\n    + This is useful if you want to have a specific ratio between filters for example\r\n    + To add a new exposure definition hit the '+' button above the table\r\n    + Put the instruction inside a loop and it will automatically pick a fitting exposure definition each time it is executed\r\n    + The exposure is picked by simply finding the minimum detail by (Progress / Ratio)\r\n    + A ratio of 0 will deactivate the row",
