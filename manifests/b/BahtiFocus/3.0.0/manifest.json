        "LongDescription": "*Prerequisites*\r\n\r\n- [N.I.N.A 3.0](https://nighttime-imaging.eu/2024/03/18/n-i-n-a-3-0/)\r\n- A connected camera (see [N.I.N.A documentation](https://nighttime-imaging.eu/docs/master/site/quickstart/equipment/))\r\n\r\n*Usage*\r\n\r\n- Install the plugin automatically with the N.I.N.A plugin manager or manually place the DLL file into `%localappdata%\\NINA\\Plugins`.\r\n    - A new panel will appear in the `Imaging` tab called `Bahtinov Analyser`.\r\n- Create or purchase a Bahtinov mask for your instrument (see [Bahtinov section](#bahtinov-mask)).\r\n- Connect your camera to N.I.N.A.\r\n- Choose, slew, and center a star in your camera's view.\r\n    - If the star isn't bright enough, the lines created by the Bahtinov mask will not be visible.\r\n- Place the Bahtinov mask on your instrument.\r\n- Set the options in the `options` toolbar of the `Bahtinov Analyser` for exposure time, filters, etc.\r\n    - **Note**: Information is taken from N.I.N.A options, such as focal length from `Options > Equipment`.\r\n- Press the start button to begin the exposure.\r\n- After the first photo is taken and appears on the right, you will see a rectangle on the right side of the screen.\r\n    - The rectangle indicates the area analyzed on the left. You can move or zoom it using the controls at the bottom to center it on the star.\r\n- The analysis will continue automatically, and you can adjust the focus of your instrument to find the critical focus.\r\n- Once the critical focus is achieved, you can stop the process and remove the Bahtinov mask!\r\n",
