        "ShortDescription": "Get the most out of the NINA Advanced Sequencer!",
        "LongDescription": "## This plugin contains a variety of potentially useful instructions that enhance the power of the Advanced Sequencer.  The set of these instructions is expected to increase over time; consider them 'utility' instructions.  Many of these instructions allow you to take arbitrary sets of actions when specific circumstances arise; you specify these actions by dragging instructions into place, just as you would to create any instruction set or template.\r\n\r\n## Among the more powerful Powerups are those related to Constants, Variables, and Expressions, and the Template by Reference instruction.\r\n\r\n\r\n# Complete documentation for Sequencer Powerups is at [Powerups Docs](https://marcblank.github.io)\r\n\r\n## Comments, suggestions, bug reports, etc. are welcomed!  Contact me by DM @chatter on the NINA Discord server, or post in the #sequencer-powerups channel.\r\n",
