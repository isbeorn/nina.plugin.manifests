        "LongDescription": "\r\nThis is a [N.I.N.A.](https://github.com/isbeorn/nina) plugin that aims to move performance-hungry functions to a compiled C++ code.\r\n\r\nIt works by injecting C# replacement functions that link to C++ code, with [Harmony](https://harmony.pardeike.net/).\r\n\r\nMy work on this plugin mainly consists of the Injection scripts, OpenCL Management, and some Optimizations.\r\nA large portion of the code is just an translation of the original N.I.N.A and Accord.NET algorithms. Hence those C++ translation remains under the licenses of their sources. A updated copy of the different licenses is available at the top of concerned files.\r\n\r\nThis plugin allow great performance gains on smaller configurations, with no impact on results.\r\n\r\nExample: Ultrabook with an Intel I5 6200U (2c/4t) + 4Gb DDR4 => arround 2.5 times reduction on snashot pipeline (debayering & stars detections) => from arround 17s to 6s on a Nikon Z6II 24mp raw shot for 5000+ stars.\r\n\r\n# Requirements:\r\nThis plugin requires [Microsoft Visual C++ Redistributable X64](https://aka.ms/vc14/vc_redist.x64.exe).  \r\nIf not installed, you will encounter a missing \"CGPUNINA.Wrapper\" or \"CGPUNINA.Native\" error.\r\n",
