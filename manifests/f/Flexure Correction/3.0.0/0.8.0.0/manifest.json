        "ShortDescription": "A plugin that evaluates and corrects drift due to differential flexure.",
        "LongDescription": "**What is differential flexure?**\r\n\r\nWhen taking guided exposures, the guiding system will do what’s necessary to keep the stars in the same positions in its field of view.\r\nThis works on the assumption that the field of view of the guiding system and of the imaging scope are in a fixed relationship with one \r\nanother, so that guiding a star in one will result in round star images in the other.\r\n\r\nUnfortunately, this is not always true. When using separate guide and imaging scopes, their mounting is usually sufficient to keep them \r\n*approximately* in a fixed relationship, but not always in a precise way. If the guide scope mounting system, for instance, flexes a bit\r\nwhile an exposure is taken, the guiding system will “think” the stars are being tracked very precisely, while they are actually \r\nproducing short trails on the imaging sensor attached to the main scope. This is *differential flexure*: a difference in the way the \r\nguide scope and the imaging scope respond to gravity and movement over time.\r\n\r\nIf you use a guide scope, you *will* have some degree of differential flexure. \r\n\r\n**How does this plugin help?**\r\n\r\nThis plugin aims at correcting and reducing the adverse effects of differential flexure. It does so by learning how the alignment of the \r\ntwo scopes changes over time, and then instructing the guider to introduce a gradual shift in the lock position to compensate for it. \r\n\r\n**Requirements**\r\n\r\nA guider capable of shifting the lock point at a set rate is needed -- PHD2 is such a guider.\r\n\r\n**How to use the plugin**\r\n\r\nTo use this plugin, add the \"Flexure Correction\" trigger into your sequence. The trigger will detect when a light sub exposure is \r\nabout to start, and before that happens it will take a short exposure (the duration defaults to that used for plate solving, but it is \r\nadjustable in the trigger). Filter, binning, gain, and focus position will be the same used by the light sub that’s about to start. \r\nThis image will be plate solved and compared with another similar exposure that will be taken later, to determine how much the imaging \r\nscope has drifted. The drift will be used to estimate the rate of drift of the imaging scope in arcseconds per hour, and the guider will \r\nbe instructed to start gradually shifting its lock point with the same rate, but in the opposite direction, to reduce the overall drift \r\nin subsequent images.\r\n\r\nThe plugin can be configured to ignore drifts that are either too small (e.g. within the circle of uncertainty due to seeing), or too \r\nlarge (e.g. due to sudden \"mirror flop\"). These limits can be set in the plugin options page, and expressed in units of guiding RMS: \r\nfor instance, the default setting is to ignore drifts that have affected the exposure by less than its guiding RMS, or by more than 10 \r\ntimes the guiding RMS. To reduce the number of measurement exposures taken, and improve the imaging efficiency, it is possible to \r\nconfigure the trigger to take a measurement every few light subs instead. \r\n\r\n**Important**: Since dithering interferes to some extent with the \"learning\"\r\nprocess of the plugin, make sure that dithering triggers are not configured to run more frequently than the flexure correction trigger: \r\nfor example, if the flexure correction trigger is configured to take a measurement every 3 exposures, the dithering trigger should be \r\nconfigured to run every 3, 4, or more exposures, and not more frequently.\r\n\r\nAn \"aggressiveness\" parameter can also be set, to determine how much of the measured drift in each exposure will be considered \r\nto calculate the new shift rate."
