        "LongDescription": "# **FasterFlats**\r\n\r\nA lightweight plugin for N.I.N.A. that adds sequence commands to temporarily disable and re-enable auto-stretch during flat frame acquisition.\r\n\r\n## **Motivation**\r\n\r\nI run N.I.N.A. on a low-end mini PC equipped with an Intel Celeron J4125 — a processor that struggles under heavy workloads. When capturing flat frames every second, the continuous processing (especially with auto-stretch and annotation enabled) places significant strain on the CPU. This often led to performance issues and, in some cases, complete application crashes.\r\n\r\nTo address this, I created **FasterFlats** — a simple yet effective plugin that allows you to disable auto-stretch and annotation temporarily during flat capture sequences, reducing CPU load and improving stability.\r\n\r\n## **How It Works**\r\n\r\nThe plugin introduces two custom sequence items:\r\n- **Disable Auto-Stretch & Annotation**\r\n- **Enable Auto-Stretch & Annotation**\r\n\r\nInsert these commands before and after your flat capture routine to minimize processing overhead during high-frequency captures.\r\n\r\n> ⚠️ **Note**: This functionality is designed for **non-light frames only** (i.e., flats, biases, darks). Disabling auto-stretch has no effect on light frames in normal imaging sequences.",
