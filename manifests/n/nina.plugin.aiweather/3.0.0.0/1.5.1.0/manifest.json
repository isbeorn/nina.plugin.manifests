        "LongDescription": "Protect your equipment and imaging sessions with intelligent, real-time weather monitoring powered by AI vision models. AI Weather watches the sky so you don't have to.\r\n\r\n\ud83c\udf29\ufe0f REAL-TIME WEATHER MONITORING:\r\n\u2022 Automatic Sky Analysis: AI vision models analyze your all-sky camera images to determine cloud coverage, detect rain and fog\r\n\u2022 Continuous Protection: Periodic image capture and analysis runs in the background during your entire imaging session\r\n\u2022 Instant Alerts: Weather status updates in real-time with detailed condition reports and cloud coverage percentages\r\n\u2022 Live Preview: See exactly what the AI sees with the built-in camera preview panel\r\n\r\n\ud83d\udcf7 3 FLEXIBLE CAPTURE MODES:\r\n\u2022 RTSP Stream: Live video from network IP cameras (Dahua, Hikvision, etc.) with real-time preview and snapshot extraction\r\n\u2022 HTTP Image Download: Periodic image download from any URL \u2014 works with indi-allsky, AllSky, web cameras, and any HTTP-accessible image\r\n\u2022 Folder Watch: Monitors a local directory for the latest image saved by any camera software \u2014 perfect for USB cameras or custom setups\r\n\r\n\ud83e\udd16 5 AI PROVIDERS (Free to Advanced):\r\n\u2022 Local (FREE, Offline): Built-in heuristic analysis using brightness, color distribution, and edge detection \u2014 no internet needed, no API costs\r\n\u2022 GitHub Models (FREE): Access GPT-4o and GPT-4o-mini vision models with just a GitHub token \u2014 no credit card required\r\n\u2022 OpenAI: GPT-4o and GPT-4o Mini for high-accuracy cloud and weather analysis\r\n\u2022 Google Gemini: Gemini 1.5 Flash, 1.5 Pro, 2.0 Flash \u2014 fast and capable vision models\r\n\u2022 Anthropic Claude: Claude 3.5 Sonnet, 3.5 Haiku, 3 Opus \u2014 excellent at detailed image understanding\r\n\r\n\ud83d\udee1\ufe0f SAFETY FEATURES:\r\n\u2022 Configurable Cloud Threshold: Set the cloud coverage percentage that triggers an Unsafe status (e.g., 50%, 70%, 90%)\r\n\u2022 Rain Detection: Rain (including lens droplets) immediately triggers Unsafe \u2014 regardless of cloud threshold\r\n\u2022 Fog Detection: Fog conditions immediately trigger Unsafe \u2014 protects optics and prevents wasted exposures\r\n\u2022 Automatic Fallback: If the cloud AI provider fails, times out, or loses connectivity, the plugin falls back to local offline analysis\r\n\u2022 60-Second Timeout: All AI providers have a 60-second timeout to prevent indefinite hangs during analysis\r\n\u2022 ASCOM SafetyMonitor Integration: Outputs a status file compatible with the ASCOM Generic File SafetyMonitor for third-party software integration\r\n\r\n\u2699\ufe0f EASY SETUP:\r\n1. Configure your all-sky camera source (RTSP URL, HTTP URL, or watched folder path)\r\n2. Choose an AI provider and enter your API key (or use Local for zero-config offline analysis)\r\n3. Set your cloud coverage safety threshold\r\n4. Enable Write Safety Status File and configure the ASCOM Generic File SafetyMonitor\r\n5. Start monitoring \u2014 the plugin automatically protects your sequences\r\n\r\n\ud83d\udca1 BEGINNER-FRIENDLY:\r\n\u2022 Start with Local (offline) mode \u2014 no API keys needed, works out of the box\r\n\u2022 Upgrade to GitHub Models for free AI-powered analysis with just a GitHub account\r\n\u2022 Detailed activity log shows every analysis result for easy troubleshooting\r\n\u2022 Works with any all-sky camera that provides RTSP, HTTP, or file-based output\r\n\r\n\u26a1 PRO FEATURES:\r\n\u2022 Custom Analysis Intervals: Configure how often the sky is analyzed (seconds between captures)\r\n\u2022 Multiple Camera Support: Point to different camera sources as needed\r\n\u2022 Robust Error Handling: Automatic recovery from network failures, API errors, and camera disconnects\r\n\u2022 Detailed Logging: Every analysis result is logged with timestamp, provider, cloud percentage, and safety status\r\n\u2022 Seamless NINA Integration: Works with ASCOM Generic File SafetyMonitor to pause or abort sequences when conditions deteriorate\r\n\r\nTransform your all-sky camera into an intelligent weather guardian. Focus on imaging while AI Weather keeps watch over your equipment and data.",
