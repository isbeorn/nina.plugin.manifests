        "LongDescription": "This plugin for N.I.N.A allows users to send notifications directly to Discord.\r\nIt can be integrated as a trigger into the sequencer in N.I.N.A, providing seamless communication during imaging sessions.\r\nAdditionally, users can specify an image path - such as a folder where a live stacked image is stored - which will also be sent to Discord.\r\nThis makes it easy to share updates and images in real time.\r\nThe plugin also includes a trigger that can automatically create a new Discord thread and post a message after exposures, helping to keep session-related messages organized.\r\n\r\n## Options\r\n- **LiveStack:**\r\nThe LiveStack image feature needs the 'LiveStack' plugin to be installed and configured as shown in the screenshots below.\r\n\r\n## Thread Options\r\n- **Discord Bot Token:**\r\nThe authentication token of your Discord bot. Required to create threads and send messages.\r\n\r\n- **Discord Channel ID:**\r\nThe ID of the channel where the thread will be created. Must be a text channel your bot has access to.\r\n\r\n- **Thread name template:**\r\nThe thread name is defined using a pattern that can include the following placeholders: $$TARGET$$, $$DATE$$, $$DATEMINUS12$$, $$DATETIME$$, $$TIME$$.\r\n\r\n- **Thread Archive Duration:**\r\nDefines how long the created thread stays active before being auto-archived by Discord.",
