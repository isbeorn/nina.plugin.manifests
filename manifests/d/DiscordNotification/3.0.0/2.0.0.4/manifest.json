        "LongDescription": "This plugin for N.I.N.A allows users to send notifications directly to Discord. It can be integrated as a trigger to the sequencer in N.I.N.A, providing seamless communication. Additionally, users can specify an image path, such as a folder where a live stacked image is stored, which will also be sent over Discord. This makes it easy to share updates and images in real-time during imaging sessions.\r\n\r\n## Settings\r\n\r\nTo use the LiveStack image feature, you need to install the 'LiveStack' plugin and configure the settings as shown in the screenshots below.",
